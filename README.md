# GabeBot

GabeBot is a free, open-source bot for Discord servers, built using <a href="https://discord.js.org">discord.js</a>.
Right now, this bot is only for personal use and can be forked and self-hosted.

# Why Gabe?

<a href="https://meme.fandom.com/wiki/Gabe_The_Dog">Gabe The Dog</a> was a popular meme back in the day known for having a cute, high-pitched bark, which became known as a bork. Gabe's bork has been used in YouTube song remixes and gathered millions of views.

On January 20th, 2017, Gabe sadly passed away. However, his bork lives on.

I created this bot with the intention of keeping Gabe's memory alive.
