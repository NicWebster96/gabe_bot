# GabeBot

GabeBot is a free, open-source bot for Discord servers, built using <a href="https://discord.js.org">discord.js</a>.
Currently this bot is my side project to dabble in discord bot development. Feel free to fork and modify as you please!

# Why Gabe?

<a href="https://meme.fandom.com/wiki/Gabe_The_Dog">Gabe The Dog</a> is a popular meme known for having a cute, high-pitched bark which became known as bork. Gabe's bork has been used in YouTube song remixes and gathered millions of views.

On January 20th, 2017, Gabe sadly passed away. However, his bork lives on.

I created this bot with the intention of keeping Gabe's memory alive.

# Features

GabeBot's primary purpose is to bork whenever a user enters a voice channel.

## Commands

`gabe volume (1-10)` : Set the volume of gabe's bork when someone enter's the voice channel.
